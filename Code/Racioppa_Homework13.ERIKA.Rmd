Clear R's brain and turn on the dplyr and here packages
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(here)
```

Importing the Data
```{r}
DF <- read.csv(here("Data", "day_one_data_for_homework13.csv"), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
View(DF) 
```

Notice how R changed Spaces to "."'s in the Data table when imported
The column that had a "#" also changed to a "." when imported through R

#Tree names without switch
```{r}
names(DF)
```
#Changing names and viewing new Names
```{r}
names(DF)[names(DF)=="Tree.."] <- "Tree_num"
names(DF)[names(DF)=="Tree.species"] <- "Species"
names(DF)[names(DF)=="Leaf.length"] <- "leaf_length"
names(DF)[names(DF)=="leaf.width"] <- "leaf_width"
names(DF)
```
#Nice that totally worked lets move on

A more efficient way to rename the columns might be this:

```{r}
names(DF)<-c("Name", "Date", "Part", "Tree_num", "Species", "leaf_length", "leaf_width", "leaf_units")
```


```{r}
English <- DF %>%
  filter(leaf_units == "inches")
```

```{r}
Uniform_Date <- DF %>%
  filter(Date == "8/24/2022")
```
